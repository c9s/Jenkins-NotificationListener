DESCRIPTION
    Jenkins::NotificationListener is a simple TCP server listens to messages
    from Jenkins' Notification plugin,

    Jenkins::NotificationListener uses AnyEvent::Socket to create tcp server
    object, so it's a non-blocking implementation.

    This tcp server reads JSON format notification from Jenkins Notification
    plugin, and creates payload object Jenkins::Notification. the payload
    object is built with Net::Jenkins::Job, Net::Jenkins::Job::Build objects
    from the information that is provided from notification json.

    By using Jenkins::NotificationListener, you can simple use the payload
    object to interact with Jenkins server.

    To test your Jenkins notification plugin, you can also use
    jenkins-notification-listener.pl script.

        $ jenkins-notification-listener.pl
